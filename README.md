# vscode-ipe
## An interactive programming experience for Python in VS Code

This is the public README for vscode-ipe.

To get started on developing this extension, visit [the guide for developers](DEVELOPING.md).

## How to use

This extension makes available several commands starting with `IPE:` to control the behaviour.

To get started, run the `Show output pane` command. This will ask for the address and token of a running Jupyter notebook, so make sure you have this info ready.

To add a card, select some Python code and run the `Send code to output` command.

## Requirements

If you have any requirements or dependencies, add a section describing those and how to install and configure them.
