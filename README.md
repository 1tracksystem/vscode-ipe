## How to use

This extension makes available several commands starting with `IPE:` to control the behaviour.

To get started, open a Python or R file and run the `Show output pane` command (or click the icon in the top right corner). You will have the choice to create a new notebook or use an existing one (this is for development only, not a production feature).

To add a card, select some Python code and run the `Send code to output` command, or use the keyboard shortcut <kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>enter</kbd>.

## Requirements

* You must have at least Visual Studio Code version 1.23.0
